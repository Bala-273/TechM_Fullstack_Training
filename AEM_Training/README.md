# AEM Training Directory

This directory consists of all of my Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) tasks, codebase and final project. I uploaded each of my daily tasks under the folder with name relevant to the date the tasks were given. I uploaded the final project which is to build a news website in the Final_Project folder. The entire tasks and project shares a common codebase so i uploaded it separately. We can access the neccessary code files for each of the task from the common codebase.
